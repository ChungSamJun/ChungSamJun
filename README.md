- 👋 Hi, I’m @ChungSamJun
- 👀 I’m interested in developing software for soliving any challenging problem generated during nano scale device manufacturing process.
- I worked in semiconductor Metrology and Inspection technology department for about 30 years at Samsung Electronics and recently retired and started a company called nanoPDL in Korea.
- nanoPDL is a small venture company that advises, collaborates, and collaborates with Korean companies to develop measurement inspection technology to make nanoScale devices.
- I don't have any abiility to develope software, but I have just only concept, idea and experience how to solve the challengin problem of nano scale manufacturing process.
- I know well how much important the metrology and inspection technology is. I know well which technologies are needed for it.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make this kind collabration business be successful, it's software power.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on developing the software to solve the challenging problem of nano scale manufacturing process. for example, AI, deep learning, pattern generation using Generative AI.
- 📫 How to reach me is to send email ...
